// loading of data
                |_____ static data
                |_____ non static data


1. static loading phase :
        static variable - store in memory with default value
        static block    - jvm store heading in memory
        static method   - jvm store heading in memory

2. static initialization phase :
        static variable - executed
        static block    - executed
        static method   - not executed

3. main method is executed :
       in which we create a object
       during object creation step 4, 5 and 6 is done.

4. non static loading phase :
        non static variable - store in memory with default value
        non static block    - jvm store heading in memory
        non static method   - jvm store heading in memory
        constructor         - jvm store heading in memory

5. non static initialization phase :
        non static variable - executed
        non static block    - executed
        non static method   - not executed
        constructor         - not executed

3.  control goes to "constructor" :
        after execution of constructor
        it is to be said that object is loaded and initialized.

NOTE : jvm gives memory for static data
        but for non static data programmer have to request jvm for memory by object creation
