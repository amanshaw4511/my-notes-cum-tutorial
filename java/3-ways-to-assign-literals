// ways of assingment
1. direct assignment
     int a = 4 ;

2. by another variable
     int b = a ;

3. by expression
     int c = 1 + 4 ;

4. by method call
     int d = m() ;

5. by parameter assigment
     public void add ( int a, int b ){
        sop( a + b);
        }


// internal functionality of compiler during assignment

1. casting :
    |__ 
        compiler check the data type of destination and value range of data it can store
        if source data lies in range (and compatible type) of destinnation data type range then compiler successfully assign value
        if it is out of range then it gives compile time error
