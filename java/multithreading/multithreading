** Multitasking is the process of executing multiple tasks at the same time.

** Multitasking can be achieved by two ways -
 
    1. Process ( MultiProcessing)                    2. Thread ( MultiThreading)
 * each process has separate address space memory   * threads share same address space of the given process it running
 * it is heavy weight                               * it is light weight
 * cost of communication is high                    * cost of communication is low
 * switching between process is slow                * fast
