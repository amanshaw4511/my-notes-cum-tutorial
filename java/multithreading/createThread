There are two ways to create thread
    1. by extending Thread class
    2. by implementing Runnable interface
        -- advantage of implementing runnable interface is you can also extend the class with other class


1. by extending Thread class
        and overriding run method

class Multi extends Thread{
    public void run(){
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
    }
}
public Demo{
public static void main(String[] argv){
    Thread th = new Multi();
    th.run();
    // output : Thread is running
}
}


2. by implementing Runnable interface

class Multi implements Runnable{
    public void run(){
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
    }
}
public class Test{
public static void main(String[] argv){
    Thread th = new Thread(new Multi());
    th.run();
}
}
