## Physical Layer
- Specification define the transmission and reception of RAW BIT STREAM b/w a device and a shared physcial medium.
- It defines things like voltage level, timing, rates, distance, modulation, and connectors.
- No access control.
- No uniquely identified device.

### Hub
- It receive a bit from a port/device and transmit to all other port/devices connected to it.
- If two device try to send data at same time then threre is chance of collision.

## Data Link Layer
